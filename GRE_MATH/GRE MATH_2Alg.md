# Algebra
The main comcept that distinuishes algebra from arithmetic is that of a __value__, which is a letter that represents a quantity whose value is unknown. You must see the letters $x$ and $y$ used as variables. You can use variables to present a word problem in terms of unknown quantities by using algebraic expressions, equations, inequalities, and functions. 

# 2.1 Operations with Algebraic Expressions

An __algebraic expression__ has on or more variables and can be written as a single __term__ or as a sum of terms.
$$2x$$  $$y- \frac{1}{4}$$ $$w^3z+5z^2-w^2+6$$
In the examples above, $2x$ has a single term. $y-\frac{1}{4}$ has two terms and $w^3z+5z^2-w^2+6$ has four terms. A term that doesn't have variable is called a __constant__ term. A number that is multipled by variables is called the __coefficient__ of a term. For example, 5 is the coefficient of the term $5z^2$.

The same rules that govern with numbers apply to operations with algebraic expressions. Like terms can be combined by adding their cofficient. And a number or varialbe can be factored out.

$$3xy+2x-3y+4x+y=3xy+6x-2y$$
$$\frac{7x^2+14x}{2x+4}=\frac{7x(x+2)}{2(2x+2)}=\frac{7x}{2}$$

__Identity__ is a statement of equality between two variables that is true for all possible values.

$$(a+b)^2 = a^2+ab+b^2$$

# 2.2 Rules of Exponents

In the algebraic expression $x^a$, $x$ is called a __base__ and $a$ is called an __exponent__. There are seven basic ules of exponents.
1. $x^{-a}=\frac{1}{x^a}$
2. $(x^a)(x^b)=x^{a+b}$
3. $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$
4. $x^0=1$
5. $(x^a)(y^a)=(xy)^a$
6. $(\frac{x}{y})^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$
7. $(x^a)^b=x^ab$
   
But you should take care not to use these basic rules mistakenly. For example;

$$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\neqx+y$$

# 2.3 Solving Linear Equations

So, how can we solve an equation? Solving equation means to find the values of the variables that make the equation true. __Equivalent equation__ means two equations that have the same solutions. For example, $x+2=3$ and $2x+4=6$ are equivalent equations.

A __linear equation__ is an equation involving
